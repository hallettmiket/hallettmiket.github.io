The course project is worth 15% of the overall grade. It will be due shortly before the end of the semester (exact date TBA). The goal of the project is to explore programming in R. In particular, we will cover the very basics of programming in this language: variables, assignment, expressions, conditional execution, iteration, functions and some data structures.

You can complete the projectÂ in a Google Drive folder entitled "Project" and include in this directory any files you require. You can submit it to the BIOl2017 gmail account, as you have done in the past for the assignments.
