I obtained my MSc at the University of Windsor, where I attempted to better understand the protein-protein interaction between heat shock protein 70 and the dual specificity phosphatase DUSP12. After graduating, I joined the labs of Dr. Peter Rogan and Dr. Joan Knoll as a Research Technician. Over 13 years, I lead multiple projects which included the discovery of common mRNA splice-altering single nucleotide polymorphisms, the prioritization of coding and non-coding mutations observed in breast cancer genes in tumor patients, the analysis of the RNAseq data from >10,000 patients in TCGA and ICGC in order to identify splice altering mutations, the development of gene expression-based chemotherapy and radiation response models using machine learning, and using geostatistical analysis to identify COVID-19 hotspots in Ontario at high-resolution from March 2020 to June 2021.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Research Interests:</strong></p>
My recent research has been focused on utilizing both laboratory and bioinformatic techniques to identify and interpret of the effect of novel DNA variants, confirm predicted aberrant mRNA splicing events (using both qPCR and RNA sequencing data), and to build machine learning-based chemotherapy and radiation response models.
