Squids, because they were <strong>ferocious</strong>.


<p style="text-align: justify;">Montreal hasÂ a long tradition in hockey, and arguably the first game of this sport was played at McGill University. For over a decade, our team was The Squids. Oh how we tapped into the rich tradition of hockey in Montreal. The Squids were a D league intramural hockey team at McGill University.</p>
