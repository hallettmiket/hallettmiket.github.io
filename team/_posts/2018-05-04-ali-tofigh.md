Postdoctoral Fellow, <a href="http://www.bci.mcgill.ca">Breast Cancer Informatics (BCI) Group</a>, <a href="http://www.mcgill.ca">Mcgill University
</a>I'm also affiliated with the <a href="http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/">School of Computer Science</a> at McGill University.

<strong>Research interests:</strong>

My research has been mainly focused on studying problems in the intersection of math, computation, and biological applications.

As a PhD student, I worked on computationally difficult problems in the study of evolution. This led to several (discrete and stochastic) models for inferring gene duplications and horizontal gene transfers (aka lateral gene transfers). Part of this work has been published in a <a href="http://ab.inf.uni-tuebingen.de/publications_old/books/phylogenetic-networks/">textbook on phylogenetic networks</a>, written by Daniel Huson et al.

During the last year of my PhD studies, I became involved in projects related to cancer, which led to the development of a stochastic model of evolution in cancer tumors.

I was a postdoctoral fellow  at McGill University for four years, working with Professor Michael Hallett on breast cancer related projects. My current research is focused on studying breast cancer prognostic predictors, developing network models that capture interactions between tumor and tumor microenvironment, and modeling of cancer evolution using next-generation high-throughput sequencing data from tumor cells.
