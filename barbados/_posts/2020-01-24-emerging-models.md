Emerging Model Systems

This meeting brings together researchers interested in the development of new model organisms.
Each such model facilitates either exciting new questions to be asked for the first time, or 
facilitates unprecedented ability to explore fundamental questions central to the life sciences.
The emergency of  many new "non-model" model systems has been facilitated by the development of gene editing technologies,  cellular imaging, and single cell genomics.
This workshop brings together investigators interested in the develop of such methodology to exploit the unique biological feature of these organisms.

In particular, we have invited individuals championing emerging model systems across a broad swath of the Tree of Life. This includes protist, bacterial and fungal unicellular model sytems for studying carbon sequestration in marine sytems, single cellular regeneration, and  to identify fundamentally conserved element of genome structure and organization.
We have also invited individuals who have developed novel models in multicellular organisms including sytems to study regeneration, tissue morphology,  and neural function. Some invitees will present models  that may more accurately recapitulate key aspects of human disease compared to murine systems currently in use. We have also invited researchers interested in the development of systems to study  organismal interactions  in various environments. Lastly, several researchers will present systems that promise efficacy for the development of synthetic bionanotechnology. 
Underlying much of this research lies techniques in -omics, microscopy and computational/statistical biology.


A **preliminary** schedule for the meeting will be posted in the Fall of 2020.  Unless indicated otherwise, the talks are scheduled to be 30 minutes.
