Emerging Model Systems

This meeting brings together researchers interested in the development of new model organisms.
Such models either facilitate exciting new questions that can be asked for the first time, or 
facilitate unprecedented ability to explore long-standing fundamental questions central to the life sciences.
The emergency of  many new "non-model" model systems has been facilitated by the development of gene editing technologies,  cellular imaging, and single cell genomics.
Our goal is also to  bring  investigators interested in the develop of such methodology to exploit the unique biological features of these organisms.

In particular, we have invited individuals championing emerging model systems across a broad swath of the Tree of Life. This includes protist, bacterial and fungal unicellular model systems for studying carbon sequestration in marine sytems, single cellular regeneration, and  genome organization.
We have also invited individuals who have developed novel models in multicellular organisms including sytems to study regeneration, tissue morphology,  and neural function. Some invitees will present models  that may more accurately recapitulate key aspects of human disease in comparison to systems currently in use. We have also invited researchers interested in the development of models to study  organismal interactions  in various environments.
Lastly, some invitees are experts in developing synthetic biology, -omics, microscopy and computational/statistical biology approaches to model systems.


A **preliminary** schedule for the meeting will be posted in the Fall of 2020.  Unless indicated otherwise, the talks are scheduled to be 30 minutes.
