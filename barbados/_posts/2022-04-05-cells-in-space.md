Cells in Space will take place from       January 27th - February 3rd, 2023. 

This year will be our 21st Systems Biology workshop:  over the past two decades, these meetings have brought together individuals working in the diverse range of fields.

This meeting brings together researchers interested in exploring cells in their context. Recent advances have reinforced the importance of understanding where cells are localized in tissues to further characterize their similarity and differences (cell types) and shed light on their interactions, communication and functionality.

The invitees collectively champion the development and/or application of EXPERIMENTAL approaches to identify the physical location of cells based on sequencing or imaging methods, and COMPUTATIONAL models to analyze cellular information and/or predict its location.  

We are excited to extend discussions to how a wide variety of external factors and stressors, such as space travel, the exposure to microgravity and space radiation, the synergistic effect of microbiomes, infection processes, tumor microenvironments, etc., influence or alter cellular expression and epigenetics programs.
