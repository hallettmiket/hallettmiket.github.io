This workshop will take place from February 6 - February 13, 2026


This year’s workshop will bring 40-50 researchers together to explore the fundamental organization and dynamics of biological systems across multiple scales. We will examine the interconnections between cellular processes, tissue ecosystems, and organismal health (human and non-human). The workshop brings together experts who rarely meet at the same conference (molecular biologists, microbiome specialists, computational biologists and environmental scientists). 
Focus Areas:

-	Cellular and tissue ecosystem dynamics including the tumor microenvironment
-	Complex networks across marine, terrestrial, microbial systems and human disease.
