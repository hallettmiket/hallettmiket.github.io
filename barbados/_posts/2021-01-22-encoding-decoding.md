<strong><p style="color:blue">Encoding an Decoding Function in the Genome. Friday January 22nd to Friday January 29th, 2021</p></strong>


This meeting brings together researchers interested in approaches that systematically modify and perturb genomes in order 
<ul>
<li> <strong>[DECODE]</strong> to understand the function of the target loci in terms of gene expression and regulation;</li>
<li> <strong>[ENCODE]</strong> to modify the function of the target loci to change its expression and regulation for specific goals.</li>
</ul>

The invitees  collectively champion modern -omic approaches that often include precise genome editing (eg CRISPR/Cas9)
applied to populations in a high-throughput manner using different strategies (eg lentiviral infections or robotic delivery),
tracked in different ways (eg competitive growth assays versus single cell droplet encapsulation), and profiled with -omic
and microscopy technologies.
Such systematic screens are central to exploring 
<ul>
<li> to build codebooks describing interactions between DNA, RNA, protein, and genome struture;</li>
<li> to decipher the multivariate  biology of higher order genetic and biochemical interactions;</li>
<li> to understand the interconnected  relationships in systems from ecology, health,  and disease; </li>
<li> to efficiently optimize systems  in the context of  synthetic biology.</li>
</ul>
