Encoding an Decoding Function in the Genome. Friday January 22nd to Friday January 29th, 2021


This meeting brings together researchers interested in approaches that systematically modify, disrupt, perturb or 
query genomic loci in order 
<ul>
<li> to understand the function of the target loci in terms of gene expression and regulation;</li>
<li> to modify the function of the target loci to change its expression and regulation for specific goals.</li>
</ul>

The invitees  collectively champion modern -omic approaches that often include precise genome editing (eg CRISPR/Cas9)
applied to populations in a high-throughput manner using different strategies (eg lentiviral infections or robotic delivery),
tracked in different ways (eg competitive growth assays versus single cell droplet encapsulation), and profiled with -omic
and microscopy technologies.
Such systematic screens are central to exploring the multivariate  biology of higher order genetic and biochemical interactions,
and to understand the interconnected  relationships in a wide range of systems from ecology, basic biology,  and disease.
