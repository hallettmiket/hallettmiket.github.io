<p>
For graduate students (BIOL 630) there is a small course project that is worth 10% of the overall grade. 
It will be due at the end of the semester. </p>

<p>
I recommend one of the following two options (if you have a different idea, then please approve it with me first.)</p>

<p>
<strong>Option 1. Python</strong>
The goal of the project is to learn  the basics of Python, an often used language in bioinformatics. You would be expected to show proficiency in the language to approximately the same level as lectures 1 through 8 here. </p>

<p>
<strong>Option 2. Julia</strong>
Julia is  relatively new language that is increasingly used in bioinformatics. You would be expected to show proficiency in the language to approximately the same level as lectures 1 through 8 here.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Option 3. Web-development using the "Bedford strategy".</strong>
Trevor Bedford created a nice framework for lab websites and made it it open source/open access. Many labs, including my lab, developed our websites from this code. In this project, you would develop a website starting from Bedford's approach for your lab. (I am open to other starting points too but the approach should use modern web development languages and tools.)
</p>

<p>
<strong>Option 4. Visualization</strong>
The goal of the project is to explore visualization in R using the
<a href="http://shiny.rstudio.com/">Shiny</a> package, produced by RStudio. Although you are welcome to develop a Shiny tool from scratch, it might be easier to start wth an example tool from the <a href="http://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/">Shiny Gallery</a>.
Pop some popcorn and watch the  <a href="http://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/">Shiny tutorial videos.</a></p>
 
<p>
<strong>Option 5. Deep Learning</strong>
Develop a deep neural network for a problem related to biology. This can be done using one of several 
packages for deep learning in R. For example, you can use KERAS in R. 
Start here by looking at some examples KERAS <a href=https://keras.rstudio.com/articles/examples/index.html>KERAS Examples</a>.
Maybe I will allow you to use my lab's GPU cluster but start with with your
local CPUs.</p>

<br><br>
<strong>Criteria for the project.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Work in a group of 1-4 students. Ideally you have similar research goals.</li>
<li>Pick a topic close to your research heart. Perhaps the resulting tool could actually
be useful to you and your research down the road. Submit only one joint project via Google Drive (as per usual) with 
everyone listed.</li>
<li> On that note, disucss the topic with your group and perhaps even your home lab and produce a concise, small writeup covering <strong>Overall Objective</strong>, <strong>Purpose of  Tool</strong>, <strong> Area of research where the tools can be applied</strong>, <strong> Type of data used by the tool</strong>, and <strong>What data was chosen to build your tool </strong> (this could be synthetic, artificial data). (One or two sentences for each will suffice.)
</li>
<li>Build and use a Trello project to track progress and clearly state who is responsible which subtasks.)  
</li>
<li>State which example you used, and then describe the steps you used to transform this into your tool. State who in your group did what.</li>
<li> Make the changes and produce a small demonstration of your tool. This could be a small video, or it could be a knitr presentation (like what we use in class), or an alternative. Please ensure the capabilities of your tools are well explained. Also, list any modifications, bugs and extensions that remain.</li>
<li> Overall, you should each spend the equivalent time as you would on an assignment. Submit your writeup, access to your Trello page and any videos or presentations using your example data.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;



<strong> Have fun! </strong>

You can complete the project in a Google Drive folder entitled "Project" and include in this directory any files you require. You can submit it to the BIOl2017 gmail account, as you have done in the past for the assignments.
