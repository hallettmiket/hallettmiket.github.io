From a methods perspective, our primary interest is in the development of the data science and machine learning expertise for the  analysis of data geneated by  single cell profiling assays 
across  different modalities and in different contexts.
You can read about these [here](https://www.mikehallett.science/research/single-cell/). We have a long history of working in breast cancer informatics and genomics, and  continue to develop analytic methodology in this 
direction. There are a number of on-going computational projects, many of which are  rooted in deep learning.

1. Analytical techniques to capture cellular response to chemical perturbagens. This work has primarly been done in the context of 
our fungal C. albicans [projects](https://www.mikehallett.science/research/fungal-drug-profiles/). The work is based on extensions to GAN and VAEs entities from deep learning.

2. Computational vision tools for mycology. This work is primarily based on extensions to FASTER R-CNN models.

3. Methods to exploit multi-modal single cell data. This is ubiquitous throughout our projects, and relies heavily on basic statistics and visualization through deep representations.

4. The development of gene and gene product signatures related to clincial endpoints primarily in breast cancer.  See for example our 
CIHR-funded DCIS [project](https://www.mikehallett.science/research/dcis-precise/).

5. The inference and representation of biological networks. See
for example [this](https://www.mikehallett.science/research/biological-networks/).





This work has been developed with different members of our [team](https://www.mikehallett.science/team/).
