title: Single cell -omics

We have been actively developing single cell profiling assays 
across  different modalities and contexts.
Although we do work with commerical systems including, for exmaple, the Chromium (10X Genomics Inc) system, 
we are particularly interested in engineering these systems ourselves.
Although our lab does not offer a service per se, 
we  collaborate with many diverse groups in a research context and
provide our assistance to profile at the single cell level.

<ul>
<li> transcriptional profiling via sc-DROP-seq as per Macosko et al. (2015) Cell;</li>
<li> transcriptional profiling via various modified sc-DROP-seqs inspired by [Stephenson et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-02659-x) and [Booeshaghi et al.](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/521096v1) for self-design and printing of components;</li>
<li>DRONC-seq, a DROP-seq based method to sequecing individual nuclei; we have been working to get this running in FFPE tumor material;

We recently modified a DROP-seq based approach from Macosko et al. to function with the fungi C. albicans. The main differences between fungi and mammalian cells is that fungi have a cell wall that needs to be removed before they are lysed, and they have considerably less mRNA. We have been applying this system to C. albicans grown in the presence of different antifungal drugs and observed heterogeneity, with evidence of distinct subpopulations of survivors with differential survival respponses.
