title: Single cell -omics
author: Mike Hallett

We have been actively developing single cell profiling assays 
across  different modalities and contexts.
Although we do work with commerical systems including, for exmaple, the Chromium (10X Genomics Inc) system, 
we are particularly interested in engineering these systems ourselves.
Although our lab does not offer a service per se, 
we  collaborate with many diverse groups in a research context and
provide our assistance to profile at the single cell level.

<ul>
<li> transcriptional profiling via sc-DROP-seq as per Macosko et al. (2015) Cell;</li>
<li> transcriptional profiling via various modified sc-DROP-seqs inspired by [Stephenson et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-02659-x) and [Booeshaghi et al.](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/521096v1) for self-design and printing of components;</li>
<li>We recently developed a fungal DROP-seq. The main differences between fungi and mammalian cells is that fungi have a cell wall that needs to be removed before they are lysed, and they have considerably less mRNA; with [Samira Massahi](https://www.mikehallett.science/team/samira-massahi/)
</li>
<li>DRONC-seq, a DROP-seq based method to sequecing individual nuclei; we have been working to get this running in FFPE tumor material;
[Samantha Yuen](https://www.mikehallett.science/team/sam-yuen/)</li>
<li> sc-snare-seq2, a DROP-seq approach that profiles both the transcriptome and chromatin accessibility of individual cells;
with [Vanessa Dumeaux](https://lab-dumeaux.science/) and [Suhani Patel](https://www.mikehallett.science/team/suhani-patel/)</li>
<li> we are in the process of setting up several types of sc-SPLIT-seq, approaches based on barcoding of cells without microfluidics;
with [Brandon Finlay](http://www.findlaylab.ca/), [Shawn Simpson](https://www.mikehallett.science/team/shawn-simpson/)</li>
</ul>





This work has been developed with different members of our [team](https://www.mikehallett.science/team/) 
but very often in collaboration with [Vanessa Dumeaux](https://lab-dumeaux.science/) at PERFORM, Concordia,
and a broad range of additional collaborators.
