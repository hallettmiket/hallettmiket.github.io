Our lab has several projects related to the inference of biological networks.
In particular, we are developing approaches that perturb specific genes or
transcripts using genome editing including CRISPR in a high-throughput,
multivariate manner. Single cell high-throughput profiling of transcription, select proteins, or chromosomal conformations are used to deduce underlying biological networks - the regulatory and correlative relationships between genes and gene products.

We apply this to different biological systems including in the context of breast cancer with [Sylvie Mader](https://www.iric.ca/en/research/principal-investigators/sylvie-mader) at the IRIC/UdeM.
