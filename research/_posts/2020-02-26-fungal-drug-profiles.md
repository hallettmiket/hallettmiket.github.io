title: Drug tolerance and resistance in the fungi <italics>Candida albicans</italics>
author: Mike Hallett

We recently modified a DROP-seq based approach from Macosko et al to function with the fungi C. albicans. The main differences between fungi and mammalian cells are that fungi have a cell wall that needs to be removed before they are lysed, and they have considerably less mRNA. This system was used to profile  C. albicans grown in the presence of different antifungal drugs. We observed heterogeneity, with evidence of distinct subpopulations of survivors with differential survival responses.
