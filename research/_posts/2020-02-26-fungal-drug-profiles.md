title: Drug tolerance and resistance in the fungi <italics>Candida albicans</italics>
author: Mike Hallett

We recently modified the DROP-seq  protocol from Macosko et al to function with the fungus C. albicans. The main differences between fungi and mammalian cells are that the former have a cell wall that needs to be removed before lysis, and the latter have considerably more mRNA. This system was used to profile  C. albicans grown in the presence of different antifungal drugs. We observed heterogeneity in their response, with evidence of distinct subpopulations of survivors with differential survival responses.
