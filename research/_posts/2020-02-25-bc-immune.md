title: Breast cancer and the immune system
author: Mike Hallett
---

 This is a collaboration with [Vanessa Dumeaux](https://lab-dumeaux.science/) at the PERFORM Centre, Concordia, and many others including researchers and clinicians at IRIC, Sunnybrook and the CHUM.

Our group has a long history of working in breast cancer genomics and informatics.
Currently, we are investigating the role of the immune system in HER2+ breast cancers, with an emphasis on characterizing the immunological systemic response of patients, and how chages during their course of treatment.

We receive support the the Office of the VP-Research at Concordia, and other funding agencies.
