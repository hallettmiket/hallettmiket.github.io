title: Update and Postdoc position available

I haven't updated the lab site in the past year. The pandemic flew by in a storm of pure, constant work it seems.

Several things occurred:

- We are looking for a [postdoc or research assistant](https://www.mikehallett.science/blog/postdocRA/) for a breast cancer genomics/informatics project related to ductal carcinoma in situ. There is many opporunities to develop deep learning based approaches or for more traditional biostatistical analyses.

- The 2021 Bellairs workshop entitled Encoding and Decoding Function in the Genome was cancelled due to covid-19. We are picking up where we left off for the 2022 workhop [here](https://www.mikehallett.science/barbados/).

- Mike Hallett recently presented Candescence at the Candida and Candiasis 2021 meeting. A version of the talk can be found [here](https://youtu.be/A6VpKFKpZA4)

- The [manuscript](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.10.445299v1) and [deep learning software](https://osf.io/qdxbp/) for Candescence was recently released. 

- Shawn Simpson successfully completed his MSc where he analyzed the microbiome of the Barbadian coral reef. The manuscript is currently available from the [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.02.425083v1)

- With [Vincent Martin](https://www.concordia.ca/artsci/biology/faculty.html?fpid=vincent-martin), [Malcolm Whiteway](https://sites.google.com/site/whitewaylab/home) and [Agropur](https://www.agropur.com/fr), we received funding from Genome Canada/Genome Quebec for a syntheic biology application entitled Bioprocess Development for Lactose Valorisation.

- Several members of the lab with [Vanessa Dumeaux](https://lab-dumeaux.science/cv) created a not-for-profit cooperative entitled [SCIEL](sciel-coop.ca). The mandate of SCIEL is to bring deep learning-based single cell approaches to market.
