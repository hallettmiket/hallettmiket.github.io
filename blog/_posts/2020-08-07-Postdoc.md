title: Postdoctoral Position in Cancer informatics and statistics 
author: Mike Hallett
---


My collaborators and I have a posdoctoral position open that is related to a project in cancer genomics and informatics, specifically
ductal in situ carcinoma (DCIS). 
This includes Dr V Dumeaux at Concordia (Montreal), Dr E Rakovitch at Sunnybrook Hospital (Toronto), myself and others.
This is a CIHR funded project and involves the analysis of a large collection of 
profiles of DCIS tumors towards specific clinical end-points. 

We really need someone here who has a solid background in statistics and data science, preferably with some previous experience in genomics and bioinforamtics. 
The position would be co-superivsed by Dr Dumeaux and myself, and you would be integrated into our team that includes researchers from Sunnybrook Hospital (Toronto), the OICR (Toronto), UBC (Vancouver) and MD Anderson (Texas), 
providing a rich multidisciplinary environment. We are happy to work with you to provide a sufficient level of understanding with respect to the underlying biology and clinical aspects of the project.
