[RECOMB COMPARATIVE GENOMICS 2019, CALL FOR PAPERS](https://recombcg2019.bitbucket.io)

17th RECOMB Satellite Conference on Comparative Genomics, RECOMB-CG 2019

Montpellier, France - October 1-4, 2019

SCOPE

The annual RECOMB Comparative Genomics Satellite Conference (RECOMB-CG) brings
together leading researchers in the mathematical, computational and life
sciences to discuss cutting edge research in comparative genomics, with  an
emphasis on computational approaches and the analysis of novel experimental
results. The program will include keynote talks, contributed talks, and a
poster session.

The 17th RECOMB-CG conference will be held in Montpellier, France, October
1-4 2019 [webpage](https://recombcg2019.bitbucket.io). With this Call for Papers we
invite high-quality original full papers on topics related to the conference
theme. A detailed call for posters will be published later on the conference
web page.

Papers are solicited on, but not limited to, the following topics:

<ul>
<li> genome evolution </li>
<li> genome rearrangements</li>
<li> genome variation, diversity and dynamics</li>
<li> phylogenomics</li>
<li> comparative tools for genome assembly</li>
<li> population genomics</li>
<li> comparison of functional networks</li>
<li> comparative epigenomics</li>
<li> paleogenomics</li>
<li> cancer evolution genomics</li>
<li> epidemiology</li>
<li> gene identification and/or annotation</li>
</ul>

IMPORTANT DATES

<ul>
<li> Paper Submission Deadline: June 24, 2019</li>
<li> Author Notification: July 26, 2019</li>
<li> Final Version Due: August 2, 2019</li>
<li> Conference: October 1-4, 2019</li>

DETAILS ON SUBMITTING MANUSCRIPTS

Submitted papers must have not been published or be currently under
consideration for publication in any other journal or conference with formal
proceedings. All accepted papers will have to be presented by one of the
authors at the conference.

Accepted papers will be published in one of two journals:
<ul>
<li> a special issue of BMC Genomics, edited by a RECOMB-CG PC chair,</li>
<li> a special issue of BMC Bioinformatics, edited by a RECOMB-CG PC chair.</li>
</ul>

As BMC Genomics and BMC Bioinformatics are Open Access journals, there will be
an author fee of roughly £1,000 (1,000 Pounds Sterling) for publication in the
event that an article is accepted in one of these two journals.

Authors will need to indicate upon submission their preferred publication
option (BMC Genomics, BMC Bioinformatics). This preference should be stated in
the Abstract section of the Easychair submission page.  However, the final
decision about the journal for each paper will be taken by the RECOMB-CG PC
chairs and communicated to the authors upon acceptance. 

Papers must be submitted in PDF format according to the guidelines for authors 
of the respective journal:
https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/submission-guidelines/preparing-your-manuscript

Papers submitted in BMC format must be within 10 pages. A clearly marked
appendix can be added to the submission that contains supplementary material
made available to the reviewers.

All submissions must be made online, through the EasyChair submission system,
at the following address:
[submissions](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=recombcg2019)

Authors need to register on easychair before submitting. A standard PDF 
file must be received by midnight on June 24, 2016 (any time zone).
