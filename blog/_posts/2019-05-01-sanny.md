Congratulations to Sanny Khurdia  for his successful application for a graduate scholarship at the PERFORM centre at Concordia. This will allow Sanny to explore single cell approaches in the context of the human gut microbiome, complementing a project led by our long time collaborator Vanessa Dumeaux.  

Thank you also to PERFORM and the work of the evaluation committee!
