We have moved from McGill University after almost 20 years to the
[Department of Biology] (https://www.concordia.ca/artsci/biology.html)
at Concordia University where we are located in a nice new genomics building and are part of the [Centre for Structural and Functional Genomics](https://www.concordia.ca/research/genomics.html) and the [Centre for Applied Synthetic Biology](https://www.concordia.ca/research/casb.html).

This is our new web site and it will take a while to migrate our information over to it.

The group has several open position (listed on the Join page) right now, ranging from our "traditional" cancer informatic related projects to new areas (for us) related to  synthetic and fungal biology. 

We even have a very tiny wet-lab for (human tumor) sample preparation, droplet-isolation techniques and some DIY genomics.
