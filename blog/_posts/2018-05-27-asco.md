The [Canadian Cancer Society](www.cancer.ca/) released their annual report regarding cancer statistics in Canada.
The [two page summary](/pdfs/CCS-summary.pdf) underscores the dependency between survival rate and the time of diagnosis. 
Specifically, that many cancers that form deep in the body, there are diagnosed at stage 4.  Lung and colorectal, which are accessible to moderately invasive diagnostic assays, also are diagnosed late. 
That's unfortuante but represents a place where big differences could be made relatively easily.
Cervical cancer (and its screening programs in women 18-39) are good examples of this.
