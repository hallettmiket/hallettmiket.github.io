We'd like to congratulation our long-time collaborator and provider of deep insight, Vanessa Dumeaux, for receiving two start-up grants. Our lab is proud to be collaborating on a PERFORM project entitled <strong>microbe-2-brain</strong> that explores correlations betweween the gut microbiome, the systemic response, and brain patterns of over-weight individuals undergoing an exercise intervention. The second project is a Team Startup/Accelarator grant that will build a high-resolution map of cancer immunity in HER2+ breast cancer patients.

<br>
We would also like to congratulate Vicky Brunet who recently was awarded an NSERC USRA. She will be joining our lab this summer to work on projects related to the human gut microbiome.

<br> Lastly, we would like to congratulate Mathieu Harb, a new master's student in our lab, who received a scholarship from the NSERC CREATE Synthetic Biology program for two years.
