- I haven't updated the lab site in the past year. The pandemic flew by in a storm of pure, constant work it seems.Several things occurred.

- We are looking for a [postdoc or research assistant](https://www.mikehallett.science/blog/postdocRA/) for a breast cancer genomics/informatics project related to ductal carcinoma in situ. There is many opporunities to develop deep learning based approaches or for more traditional biostatistical analyses.

- The 2021 Bellairs workshop entitled Encoding and Decoding Function in the Genome was cancelled due to covid-19. We are picking up where we left off for the 2022 workhop [here](https://www.mikehallett.science/barbados/).

- Mike Hallett recently presented Candescence at the Candida and Candiasis 2021 meeting. A version of the talk can be found [here](https://youtu.be/A6VpKFKpZA4)

- The [manuscript](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.10.445299v1) and [deep learning software](https://osf.io/qdxbp/) for Candescence was recently released. 

- Aki Kiribakis successfully defended his MSc thesis. December.
