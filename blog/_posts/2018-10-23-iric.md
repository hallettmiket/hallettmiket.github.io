I just came back from the [IRIC Symposium on Machine Learning  Biological Systems](https://www.iric.ca/symposium/Main?lang=en).


A nice two day even organized by Sebastien Lemieux, Sylvie Mader , Mike Tyers, Lea Harrington and Brian Wilhelm. 
Many nice talks about how ML is being used in clincal and basic research settings.
