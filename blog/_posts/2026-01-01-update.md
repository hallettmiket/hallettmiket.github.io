- Our [Barbados 2026 - Cells to Ecosystems](/barbados) workshop is set to take place in Frebruary. This year’s workshop will bring 40-50 researchers together to explore the fundamental organization and dynamics of biological systems across multiple scales. We will examine the interconnections between cellular processes, tissue ecosystems, and organismal health (human and non-human). The workshop brings together experts who rarely meet at the same conference (molecular biologists, microbiome specialists, computational biologists and environmental scientists). 

- Congratulations to [Thomas Qu](/team/thomas-qu) for successfully completing his MSc.

- We welcome several undergraduate thesis students to the lab this year [Rowan Pereira](/team/rowan-pereira), [Jacob Madeira](/team/jacob-madeira), [Joseph Kozman](/team/joseph-kozman), [Karen Jose](/team/karen-jose) and [Jose Renzo Delos Santos](/team/jose-santos).
