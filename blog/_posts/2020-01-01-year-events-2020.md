- Our meeting this year includes approximately 50 researchers who each have
a unique "non-model" model system, or are using well-established model systems in new ways. This year has a  particularly broad range of topics including models for marine systems, cancer, development and evolution.    [Emerging Model Systems](https://www.mikehallett.science/barbados/). January

- WTF? March

- In response to covid-19, several of my students and colleagues at Concordia Department of
Biology prepared this primer into the literature of covid-19 for our students. Hopefully it assists you with exploring the disease. [A primer into the covid-19 literature](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1--n2hsdSDbIUQxX1-eynljM457Z-Q1zEDQn7GdcYA8k/edit?usp=sharing).

-  As announced by Concordia, courses will remain in an on-line format this fall.
In repsonse to these covid-19-related measures, we have optmized
the deliver of  our bioinformatics course for this format.
You can read more about it here
[BIOL 480/510/630 Bioinformatics: Data Science for Biology](https://www.mikehallett.science/courses/t4ls/). We have also modernized the structure the course to follow
closer the excellent on-line resource  [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) In essence, we will work within 
the tidyverse to better advance students visualization and data analysis skills.

-  It was a great pleasure to speak at the first 
[Canadian Fungal Network meeting](https://www.fungalresearch.ca/canfunnet2020.html) Twitter: @CanFunNet.
A lot of great talks.
Mike spoke about drug tolerance in Candida albicans. The talk is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udbD0xTuGG8).
Van spoke about a deep learning-based tool to recognize Candida albicans morphologies.

- Shawn Simpson successfully completed his MSc where he analyzed the microbiome of the Barbadian coral reef. The manuscript is currently available from the [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.02.425083v1)

- With [Vincent Martin](https://www.concordia.ca/artsci/biology/faculty.html?fpid=vincent-martin), [Malcolm Whiteway](https://sites.google.com/site/whitewaylab/home) and [Agropur](https://www.agropur.com/fr), we received funding from Genome Canada/Genome Quebec for a syntheic biology application entitled Bioprocess Development for Lactose Valorisation.

- Several members of the lab with [Vanessa Dumeaux](https://lab-dumeaux.science/cv) created a not-for-profit cooperative entitled [SCIEL](https://sciel-coop.ca). The mandate of SCIEL is to bring deep learning-based single cell approaches to market. 

- Samira Massahi successfully defended her MSc thesis.
