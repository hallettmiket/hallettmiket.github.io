  The <strong>Matched Interaction Across Tissues (MIxT)</strong> is a system designed for exploring and comparing transcriptional profiles from two or more matched tissues across individuals.

[MIxT App](https://github.com/vdumeaux/mixtApp) is an R package that serves as an intermediary between MIxT Analysis and MIxT Webserver that allows users to quickly prototype analogous dynamic websites for their own (multi-tissue) data. This is more fully described in an article in prepartion.

It makes use of  [MIxT Analysis](https://github.com/vdumeaux/mixtR), an   R package that houses the core  routines and code used for analysis and to generate visualizations, and 
[MIxT Webserver](https://github.com/fjukstad/mixt), a Google GO-based package that provides the dynamic web infrastructure, including compute services for large-scale computations. T
