This site began with the repo from the [Bedford lab](https://github.com/blab/blotter.git), then modified by the [Shah lab](https://www.mskcc.org/profile/sohrab-shah) and then modified by the Dumeaux lab. My version can be obtained from [github](https://github.com/hallettmiket/hallettmiket.github.io).

You can also obtain my undergraduate course in [computational biology/bioinformatics/data science](https://hallett-biology-datascience.netlify.app/) at [github](https://github.com/hallettmiket/datascience2021).
