## AIPS (Absolute Inference of Patient Signatures)

This github repository contains the R package that could be used to partition breast cancer gene expression profile(s) using the 1733 models defined in AIPS.

This is a fork of the repository built by my ex-PhD student <strong>Eric Paquet</strong>!

Here is how you could install AIPS in R :

* Download the AIPS package from github (https://github.com/meoyo/AIPS)

* Install AIPS in R using eg. this command from the shell :

`> R CMD INSTALL AIPS_1.0.0.tar.gz`

* The easisest way to know how to run AIPS is to read the vignette by launching R and then load AIPS using :

```R
library(AIPS)
library(Biobase)
openVignette()
```
