The <strong>Matched Interaction Across Tissues (MIxT)</strong> is a system designed for exploring and comparing transcriptional profiles from two or more matched tissues across individuals.


[MIxT Webserver](https://github.com/fjukstad/mixt) is a Google GO-based package that provides the dynamic web infrastructure using Docker. It provides compute services for large-scale computations dynamic computations.


MIxT Webserve communicates with [MIxT App](https://github.com/vdumeaux/mixtApp) to gain access to properly formatted gene expression datasets and associated statistical analyses.
