# STROMA4 

This package estimates four stromal properties identified in TNBC patients in each patient of a gene expression datasets. These stromal property assignments can be combined to subtype patients. These four stromal properties were identified in Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients and represent the presence of different cells in the stroma: T-cells (T), B-cells (B), stromal infiltrating epithelial cells (E), and desmoplasia (D). Additionally this package can also be used to estimate generative properties for the Lehmann subtypes, an alternative TNBC subtyping scheme (PMID: 21633166).


This is available as an [R/Bioconductor package](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/STROMA4.html).

The code is also available through [github](https://github.com/hallettmiket/STROMA4).
