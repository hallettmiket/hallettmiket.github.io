We are developing a community of students, researchers and professors at Concordia who are interested in expanding their abilities in
<ul>
 	<li>basic information technology (eg Unix, cloud computing, management software, databases)</li>
 	<li>programming (eg with R and Python)</li>
 	<li>specific bioinformatic software (eg Galaxy)</li>
 	<li>statistical analysis (eg linear models)</li>
 	<li>mathematical modelling (eg pathway simulations)</li>
 	<li>machine learning (eg deep learning), and</li>
 	<li>data science (eg exploring sequencing datasets).</li>
</ul>
The CompLifeSci community plans to host regular informal events with
<ul>
 	<li>invited speakers from the basic and clinical sciences</li>
 	<li>with politicians, administrators and granting agencies central to funding in Canada,</li>
 	<li>technical lectures and working sessions,</li>
 	<li>opportunities to discuss your project with people from other fields</li>
</ul>
There will of course be healthy fresh food.

Please place your email in the comments below or send me a message at michael.hallett@concordia.ca if you are interested.

(PS* We aren't sure there are any actual round tables at Concordia but that won't stop us.)
