# Abstract
Although systemic immunity is critical to the process of tumor rejection, cancer research has
largely focused on immune cells in the tumor microenvironment. To understand molecular
changes in the patient systemic response (SR) to the presence of BC, we profiled RNA in
blood and matched tumor from 173 patients. We designed a system (MIxT, Matched Interactions
Across Tissues) to systematically explore and link molecular processes expressed
in each tissue. MIxT confirmed that processes active in the patient SR are especially relevant
to BC immunogenicity. The nature of interactions across tissues (i.e. which biological
processes are associated and their patterns of expression) varies highly with tumor subtype.
For example, aspects of the immune SR are underexpressed proportionally to the level of
expression of defined molecular processes specific to basal tumors. The catalog of subtypespecific
interactions across tissues from BC patients provides promising new ways to tackle
or monitor the disease by exploiting the patient SR.
