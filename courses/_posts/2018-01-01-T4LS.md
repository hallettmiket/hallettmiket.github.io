The Fall 2019 version of the course taught by [Prof MT Hallett](https://mikehallett.science) at the [Dept of Biology](https://www.concordia.ca/artsci/biology.html) of [Concordia](https://www.concordia.ca).

More about the goals of the course can be found in [overview](/web-intro/overview.html).

The [syllabus](/web-intro/Syllabus.html) is divided into 3 modules. The first covers basic programming in R with focus on techniques often used in life science studies. 
The second introduces data science to life scientists. 
This includes descriptive statistics, visualization and statistical test.
The third covers algorithms and topics from machine learning  central to computational biology.
This year we will have a focus on <strong> deep learning </strong>.

We make use of several bioinformatic and computational biology [tools](/web-intro/tools.html).

For graduate students, the course has a small [project](/web-intro/project.html).

There are 5 [assignments](/web-intro/assignment_guidelines.html).
