The Fall 2020 version of the course taught by [Prof MT Hallett](https://mikehallett.science) at the [Dept of Biology](https://www.concordia.ca/artsci/biology.html) of [Concordia](https://www.concordia.ca).

More about the goals of the course can be found in [overview](/web-intro/overview.html).
We have optimized the course for the Fall 2020 term on-line.

The [syllabus](/web-intro/Syllabus.html) is divided into 3 modules. The first covers basic programming in R with focus on techniques often used in life science studies. 
The second introduces data science to life scientists. 
This includes descriptive statistics, visualization and statistical test.
The third covers algorithms and topics from machine learning  central to computational biology.
This year we will have a focus on <strong> deep learning </strong>.

Lectures consist of a pre-recorded set of short videos with my voice over. Between videos, there are small exercises to help you understand the material. In class times, I will be there to work through the material with you. Quizes (4 at 5% each) will be in class and 10 minutes each. The midterm (20%) will be a one hour take-home exam. The final (20%) will be 2 hour take home. Here is the [evaluation](/web-intro/assignment_guidelines.html) criteria.

For graduate students, the course has a small [project](/web-intro/project.html), equivlent to a typical assignment, where they can explore bioinformatics in more depth in their area of life science interest.
