The Fall 2020 version of the course taught by [Prof MT Hallett](https://mikehallett.science) at the [Dept of Biology](https://www.concordia.ca/artsci/biology.html) of [Concordia](https://www.concordia.ca).

More about the goals of the course can be found in [overview](/web-intro/overview.html).
We have optimized the course for the Fall 2020 term on-line.

The [syllabus](/web-intro/Syllabus.html) is broadly divided into 3 modules. The first module will provide you with the concepts, skills and tools necessary to conduct <strong> data science with biological data </strong>.
For this we will use the R langauge. Data science is the process of getting your data into a computer in an appropriate way and the applicaiton of  descriptive statistics, visualization and statistical tests to explore your data. 
The second module is <strong>bioinformatics</strong>. Here we talk about resources, databases and tools for molecular data. 
The third covers <strong>computational biology</strong>. This is the development of new techniques, typically expressed as computer programs, to explore data. There is a strong focus on machine learning, particularly the basics of <strong> deep learning </strong>.

Lectures consist of a pre-recorded set of short videos with my voice over. Between videos, there are small exercises to help you understand the material. In class times, I will be there to work through the material with you. Quizes (4 at 5% each) will be in class and 10 minutes each. The midterm (20%) will be a one hour take-home exam. The final (20%) will be 2 hour take home. Here is the [evaluation](/web-intro/assignment_guidelines.html) criteria.

For graduate students, the course has a small [project](/web-intro/project.html), equivlent to a typical assignment, where they can explore bioinformatics in more depth in their area of life science interest.
