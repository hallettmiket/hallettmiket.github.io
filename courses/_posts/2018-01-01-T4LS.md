More about the goals of the course can be found in [overview](/web-intro/overview.html).

The [syllabus](/web-intro/Syllabus.html) is divided into 3 modules. The first covers basic programming in R. The second introduces data science to life scientist. The third covers algorithmic and machine learning topics central to computational biology.

We make use of several bioinformatic and computational biology [tools](/web-intro/tools.html).

The course has a [project](/web-intro/project.html) worth 15% of the overall grade.

There are 5 [assignments](/web-intro/assignment_guidelines.html) worth 40% of the overall grade
