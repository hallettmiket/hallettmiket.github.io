The Winter 2019 version of the course taught by [Prof MT Hallett](https://mikehallett.science) at the [Dept of Biology](https://www.concordia.ca/artsci/biology.html) of [Concordia](https://www.concordia.ca).

The course is only open to graduate students but it is open to students from the life (eg Biology, Biochemistry) or
quantitative sciences (eg computer science) with permission from their department.

More about the goals of the course can be found in [overview](/acb-web-intro/overview.html).



We make use of several bioinformatic and computational biology [tools](/acb-web-intro/tools.html).

The course has a [project](/acb-web-intro/project.html) worth 30% of the overall grade and a presentation worth 30%.
