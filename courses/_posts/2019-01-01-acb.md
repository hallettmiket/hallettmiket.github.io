The Winter 2019 version of the course taught by [Prof MT Hallett](https://mikehallett.science) at the [Dept of Biology](https://www.concordia.ca/artsci/biology.html) of [Concordia](https://www.concordia.ca).

The course is only open to graduate students but it is open to students from the life (eg Biology, Biochemistry) or
quantitative sciences (eg computer science) with permission from their department.

More about the goals of the course can be found in [overview](/acb-web-intro/overview.html).

The [syllabus](/acb-web-intro/Syllabus.html) is divided into 3 modules. The first covers basic programming in R. The second introduces data science to life scientist. The third covers algorithmic and machine learning topics central to computational biology.

We make use of several bioinformatic and computational biology [tools](/acb-web-intro/tools.html).

The course has a [project](/acb-web-intro/project.html) worth 50% of the overall grade.

There are 5 [assignments](/acb-web-intro/assignment_guidelines.html) worth 40% of the overall grade
