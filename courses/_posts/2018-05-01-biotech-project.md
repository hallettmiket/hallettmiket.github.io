<br> <strong> A brief meeting for BIOL 516 will take place on <bf>Tuesday September 10, 11am in GE S120 (Baement; someone will open the door for you).
If you can't make it then, then at 2:40pm at GE 120.07. Pleae email me otherwise.</strong>
<br><br>

<br><br><br>
This is a two semester course offered as part of the Graduate Diploma in Biotechnology and Genomics  at the [Dept of Biology](https://www.concordia.ca/artsci/biology.html) of [Concordia](https://www.concordia.ca). The instructor is [Prof MT Hallett](https://mikehallett.science).


<strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Permission	of	the	Diploma	Program	Director.	


Each	student	conducts	a	project	under	the	supervision	of	a	faculty	member	at	Concordia	 or	other	research	institutions	affiliated	with	the	program.The	research	project	is	carried over	an	8-month	(10	hours	per	week).	The	project	 will	be	chosen	from	one	or	more	of	the	following	fields:	biotechnology,	genomics, bioinformatics,	and	 high-throughput	experimentation.	The	nature	of	the	project	can	be	research,	development,	or	 application.	A	student	who	is	working	full-time	or	part-time	can	pursue	the	project	in	his/her	place	of	 employment	subject	to	approval.	(Approval	will	only	be	given	to	projects	which	are	clearly	 demonstrated	to	be	independent	of	the	regular	work	requirement).	

The course proceeds as follows.


<ol> 
<li>At the very beginning of, or prior to, the semester, you need to find a supervisor to guide your project. </li>

<strong>Here are a few professors who have BIOL 516 projects available. It is not a complete list, and you should approach others.</strong>

<br>

<li>You and your supervisor must fill out the <strong> supervisor admission form</strong> (below). You need to send it, or an electronic version, to both the <a href="mailto:biograd.fas@concordia.ca">Graduate Program Administrator</a> and <a href="mailto:hallett.mike.t@gmail.com">me</a>.</li>

<li> After you have submitted your forms and with permission from the instructor, the <strong>graduate program administrator</strong> registers you for the course (you cannot do it yourself).</li>

<li> In the first two weeks of term, you have a private 10 minute meeting with the instructor where you describe your project. This is a check to make sure you are set up to complete the project before the drop date. </li>

<li> Near the end of the second term (last 1.5 months), you give a 15 minute presentation with ~10 minutes of questions. This is worth <strong>30%</strong> of your overall grade. </li>

<li> Near the end of the second term (last 1.5 months), you prepare a poster and pressent it with a two minute presentation, followed by questions. This is worth <strong>30%</strong> of your overall grade. </li>

<li> At the end of your two semsters, your supervisor provides a grade for your research that constitutes <strong>40%</strong> of your grade.</li>

</ol>

Here are [some hints for finding a supervisor.](/assets/pdfs/courses/biol516/find.supervisor.pdf) 

The scheduling options are [here](/assets/pdfs/courses/biol516/schedule.options.pdf).

The format, expectations and structure of the 10 minute talk are described [here](/assets/pdfs/courses/biol516/oral.presentation.pdf)

<br>
<strong>Avoiding	plagiarism.</strong> Since	the	course	work	requires	written	works	(presentation	slides and poster),	I	need	to	remind	of	you	of	good	citation	practice.	Throughout	the	text,	you	should	be	clear	on	what	part	has	been	cited	from	which	articles.	Please	visit	the	[Academic	Integrity	Website](http://www.concordia.ca/students/academic-integrity.html).	
Also,	Concordia	University	Library	has	a	good	[referencing	guide](http://library.concordia.ca/research/subjects/biology/).	Watch this	[self-tutorial](http://library.concordia.ca/research/subjects/biology/plagiarism/plagiarism_video.htm)	on	how	to	acknowledge	information	sources	(prepared	by	Concordia	librarian	Ms.	Danielle	Dennie).

<br>
<strong>Plagiarism:	</strong>
The	most	common	offense	under	the	Academic	Code	of	Conduct	is	plagiarism	which	the	Code	defines	as	"the	presentation	of	the	work	of	another	person	as	one's own	or	without	proper	acknowledgement."

<br>
This	 could	 be	 material	 copied	 word	 for	 word	 from	 books,	 journals, internet	 sites,	 professor's	 course	notes,	etc.	It	could	be	material	that	is paraphrased	but	closely	resembles	the	original	source.	It	could	be	the	 work	 of	 a	 fellow	 student,	 for	 example,	 an	 answer	 on	 a	 quiz,	 data	 for	 a	 lab	 report,	 a	 paper	 or	 assignment	 completed	 by	 another	 student.	 It	might	 be	 a	 paper	 purchased	 through	 one	 of	 the many	available	sources.	Plagiarism	does	not	refer	to	words	alone	- it	can	also	refer	to	copying	images,	graphs,	 tables,	 and	 ideas.	 "Presentation"	 is	 not	 limited	 to	 written	 work.	 It	 also	 includes	 oral	 presentations,	computer	 assignments	 and	 artistic	 works. Finally,	 if	 you	 translate	 the	 work	 of	 another	 person	 into	 French	or	English	and	do	not	cite	the	source,	this	is	also	plagiarism.

<br>
In	Simple	Words:DO	NOT	COPY,	PARAPHRASE	OR	TRANSLATE	ANYTHING	FROM	ANYWHERE	WITHOUT	SAYING	FROM WHERE	YOU	OBTAINED	IT!

<br>
If	you	are	not	sure	how	to	paraphrase	without	plagiarizing,	please	refer	to	this	example	given	by	the	[Academic	 Integrity	 information	 site.](http://www.concordia.ca/students/academicintegrity/plagiarism.html)
