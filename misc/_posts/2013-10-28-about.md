## Web design

Like many others, we have adopted the website design from the Bedford Lab which is graciouly open sourced [GitHub](https://github.com/blab).  We thank [bedford.io](http://bedford.io) very much for this excellent resource! 

## Lab software

We are big fans of open source software especially [R](https://www.r-project.org/), [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/), and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/).
