## Web design

Like many others, we have adopted the website design from the Bedford Lab which is graciously open sourced [GitHub](https://github.com/blab).  We thank [bedford.io](http://bedford.io) very much for this excellent resource! 

## Lab software

We are big fans of open source software especially [R](https://www.r-project.org/), [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/),  [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), 
[Python](https://www.python.org/), [Julia](https://julialang.org/), [Keras](https://keras.io/), and [PlaidML](https://plaidml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
